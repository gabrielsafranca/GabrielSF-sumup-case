# SumUp case study

This repository contains my solution for the SumUp case study.

## Repository structure
- `sql/1_Table_Creation.sql` – SQL for table creation
- `sql/2_Task_resolution.sql` – SQL for task analysis and calculations
- Case_SumUp_support.csv - Supporting Google Sheets for copy GBQ results
- GabrielSF_SumUP_Case_resolution.pdf - Case task solution
- GabrielSF_SumUP_Additional_SupportOperationsReview.pdf - Presentation prepared for the VP of Operations and the Director of Support, Europe

## How was my process
- Import the CSV table into Google BigQuery
- Play around with the table, run some tests, and validate the data
- Interpret the case based on the data available
- Draft possible solutions, analyses, and table formats
- Use GBQ to create the table (sql/1_Table_Creation.sql)
- Work with the table, validate data, and test whether it answers my questions
- Use GBQ to answer the task questions 1 to 4 (sql/2_Task_resolution.sql)
- Program, test, and validate my hypotheses
- Create a Google Sheet to copy some results from GBQ
- Write a Google Doc with my case solution
- Create a Git repository
